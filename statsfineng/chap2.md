## 2.4.2 Simulation

Number of iterations: **1e5**

Probability of 50000$ loss: **58.844%**

Probability of 100000$ profit: **38.775%**

Probability of loss: **59.518%**

Expected profit: **9922.63$**

Expected return on investment: **0.9989775** [^1]

[^1]: Note this corresponds to an average loss, even though the strategy is expected to turn a profit. This is due to the fact that returns are time-adjusted. Since there are more losses than profits, the majority of the return will average below 1. Though the profits are nominally greater than the losses, the profits take longer to materialize and hence the time-adjustment wipes out those details.
